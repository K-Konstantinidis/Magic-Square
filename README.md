# Magic-Square
This is a C project. The user inserts 2 numbers, and then the program creates and shows the magic square 
that these 2 numbers create.

The 2 numbers the user inserts, are 2 integers. After the insertion of the numbers, the magic square (m.s.)
will be created and displayed on the screen.

Beneath the m.s., a message will appear informing you if the square is a magic one or not.
